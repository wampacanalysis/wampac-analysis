Wide area monitoring, protection, and control (WAMPAC) systems are essential to enhance the reliability and stability of modern smart grids. However, these systems are vulnerable to cyberattacks, such as false data injection (FDI), which can disrupt communication links and control mechanisms, leading to instability. This work analyzes the security implications of such attacks by modeling the dynamic interactions between key control mechanisms, including automatic generation control and power system stabilizers. By framing the attacker's actions as an optimization problem, we demonstrate how control signals can be manipulated, potentially compromising system stability. The proposed analysis reveals the attack resiliency of the wide-area control system and helps to identify critical nodes, thus enabling a more resilient system design. Existing research often overlooks the opportunity to fully capture these dynamic interactions and test their strategies across diverse scenarios, highlighting the uniqueness and significance of this work. We validate the attack vector using real-time simulation on a multi-area power system, proving the attackers' capacity to cause adverse impacts with optimal FDI attacks. This research is essential to address the critical need for strong security enhancements inside WAMPAC systems to limit risks posed by optimum FDI attacks and ensure the uninterrupted operation of smart grid infrastructures.
